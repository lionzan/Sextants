# Sextants
### Building sextants
In this repository you'll find about building sextants. Both an optical/mechanical version and an optical/digital version.

The [optical/mechanical version](https://github.com/lionzan/Sextants/wiki/Optical-Sextant) is made entirely of lasercut acrylic sheet, plus 6 steel screws, a few rubber bands or O-rings and a scope. Optionally the filters can be made of an LCD Shutter controlled by an Arduino, so there's a bit of digital there as well!

The challenge in the optical/mechanical version is to make a precise enough instrument by using only acrylic sheet, also for the bearings of the rotating parts. Should this approach fail, I'll consider using small steel ball-bearings.

The [optical/digital version](https://github.com/lionzan/Sextants/wiki/Digital-Sextant) is made of an Arduino controller with a bunch of sensors, an OLED display, a shatterproof glass and a scope.

The challenge here is to get enough precision from the MPU. On top of making work a bunch of sensors and connecting at least 2 arduinos together!
