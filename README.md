# Sextants
### Building sextants
In this repository you'll find about building sextants. Both an optical/mechanical version and an optical/digital version.

The optincal/mechanical version is made entirely of lasercut acrylic sheet, plus 6 steel screws, a few rubber bands or O-rings and a scope.

The optical/digital version is made of an Arduino controller with a bunch of sensors, an OLED display, a shatterproof glass and a scope.
